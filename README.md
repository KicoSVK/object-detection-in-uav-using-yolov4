# Object Detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Camera Stream Using Deep Neural Network
This work represents another way of using the detection and subsequent analysis of objects from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective. The whole system uses one camera, which is suitably positioned on the UAV to capture the scene. Image processing and subsequent object detection using the YOLOv4 convolutional neural network model. The YOLO model was trained on our own dataset. This training set was created specifically for UAV applications. The result of this work is a learned YOLO neural network model designed for UAVs with regard to the used training set.
